 Abstract:
 A simple view to display various pieces of information about a time zone. Because the the view's content is fairly complex, it draws its content directly in drawRect: to optimize scolling performance.
  The implementation is very basic -- it doesn't attempt to constrain text to particular areas to aviod overlapping and so on. It does, though, illustrate response to highlighting.
